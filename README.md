# Best practices in Flutter development

Do's and Don'ts for Flutter development, heavily inspired from the [android-best-practices](https://github.com/futurice/android-best-practices)

## Summary

#### [Add a linting rules firstly when starting app from scratch](#lint-rules)
#### [Use const wherever possible](#use-const)
#### [Create separate class to define the colors](#separate-color-class)
#### [Define theme for your app](#define-theme)

----------

### lint-rules
Whenever you start a project from scratch firstly add [Lint](https://pub.dev/packages/lint) package which can help you to statically analyzed your flutter/dart code and can help you to improve your code quality which evantually reduces the bugs and errors.


### use-const

Try using a const keyword wherever possible, to improve the performance of the app. For example: When you use it for some widgets and when `setState` gets called it does not change the `widget` with the `const` keyword.

```dart
const Text(
  "Flutter Best Practices",
  style: const TextStyle(
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
  ),
),
```

### separate-color-class

Try to have all the colors in a single class for your application, do it with the Strings as well if you are not using the localization so whenever you want to add localization you can find all the strings in one place.

Note: You might get the linting error `avoid_classes_with_only_static_members` but it is okay to ignore for this kind of usage.

Quoting the official [documentation](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/design#avoid-defining-a-class-that-contains-only-static-members): 
> In idiomatic Dart, classes define kinds of objects. A type that is never instantiated is a code smell.
> However, this isnâ€™t a hard rule. With constants and enum-like types, it may be natural to group them in a class.

Color Example:

```dart
class AppColor {
  static const Color red = Color(0xFFFF0000);
  static const Color green = Color(0xFF4CAF50);
  static const Color errorRed = Color(0xFFFF6E6E);
}
```

### define-theme

Define Theme of the app as well as a first priority to avoid the headache of changing the theme in future updates, Setting up Theme is surely confusring but one time task.
Ask your designer to share all the Theme related data like, Colors, font sizes and weightage.

Example:
```dart
MaterialApp(
  title: appName,
  theme: ThemeData(
    // Define the default brightness and colors.
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
    
    // You can add the color from the seprate class here as well to maintain it well.
    primaryColor: Colors.lightBlue[800],

    // Define the default font family.
    fontFamily: 'Georgia',

    // Define the default `TextTheme`. Use this to specify the default
    // text styling for headlines, titles, bodies of text, and more.
    textTheme: const TextTheme(
      headline1: TextStyle(fontSize: 72.0, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
      headline6: TextStyle(fontSize: 36.0, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
      bodyText2: TextStyle(fontSize: 14.0, fontFamily: 'Hind'),
    ),
  ),
  home: const MyHomePage(
    title: appName,
  ),
);
```

You can do much more with the Theme, which is defining your custom TextField, Card, Bottom Navigation Bar themes for once and use it straight away in the app. Checkout an example of using Theme over [here](https://github.com/ibhavikmakwana/supabase_playground/blob/master/lib/values/theme.dart)

>In Addition, In a large app/project you might end up having a multipl Themes not just light and dark mode themes but Custom themes for some specific widgets/components as well so you can always create a separate class/file and maintain all the themes over there.
